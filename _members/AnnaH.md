My research focuses on quantitative genetics in wild populations, exploring how genetics influence important traits such as survival or morphology. 
In the Goudet group, I mainly work on the long-term barn owl project (in collaboration with the Roulin group), investigating the impacts of inbreeding depression in this population, with many other exciting projects on the horizon!
