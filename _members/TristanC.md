I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group, where I study how populations evolve across time and space, up to the formation of distinct species. My research combines population genomics, evolutionary biology, and ecology to understand the mechanisms underlying adaptation, diversification and speciation.
I am broadly interested in understanding how the full spectrum of genomic variation contributes to evolutionary change,  including not only single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), but also structural variants such as inversions, duplications, and other large-scale rearrangements. 
During my PhD, I investigated the genomic consequences of domestication in sheep and goats, examining how both human selection and environmental pressures shaped their genomes, with a special focus on the role of structural variations. Currently, my work focuses on the European barn owl (Tyto alba), where I study the species' evolutionary history and trait variation across the Western Palearctic. This includes research on the genetic basis of phenotypic traits like plumage coloration, and how genomic architecture contributes to their evolution and adaptation across ecological gradients.
By integrating fieldwork, high-throughput sequencing, and statistical genetic and ecological modeling, I aim to develop a more comprehensive view of how populations and species adapt and evolve.
