I am fascinated by the complexity of the speciation process and in particular the role that hybridization plays in species divergence and adaptation. With a background on genomics of adaptation of hybrid species, my research focused on the balance between high genetic variation and the limitations generated by genetic incompatibilities, both inherent to admixed genomes.
Currently, in the Goudet group, I'm working on the evolutionary history of barn owls and the processes that could have contributed to their diversification (e.g introgression). For this project we are reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships among Tyto species, using ~180 genomes from museum specimens across 15 species, with a worldwide distribution.
