With a background in computational biology and experience in diverse fields —population genomics, ancient DNA, immunoinformatics and oncology data science — I now focus on making our group’s research more efficient and reliable. I aim to achieve this by building automated, reproducible bioinformatics workflows, thoroughly documenting our tools, and developing databases.
