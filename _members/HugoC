I am interested in understanding the evolutionary implications of structural variants, in particular of chromosomal inversions. At the moment, I mostly work with Swiss barn owls (_Tyto alba_) and try to understand whether chromosomal inversions induce a fitness and phenotypic impacts. Later on, I plan to take advantage of museum samples from other additionnal _Tyto_ species and study the impact of inversions at a larger phylogenetical scale.
