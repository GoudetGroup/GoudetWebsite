During my PhD in this group I specialised in bioinformatics and population genomics, focusing on how to measure inbreeding and its effects. I discovered that what excites me most is the engineering side of science: writing clean code, troubleshooting at scale, and turning “noisy” datasets into resources other people can use with confidence. Now my aim is to build a well organized and user-friendly database containing data for a bit more that 3,000 barn owls (Tyto alba) individuals.
