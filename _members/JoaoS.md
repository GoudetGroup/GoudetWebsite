I am interested in understanding the role of introgression in driving population divergence and speciation. For my PhD (in collaboration with the Schwander group) I am using pangenomics, museomics, genetic simulations and comparative genomics tools to detect instances of introgression along the genome in four different model systems: _Bacillus_ stick insects, _Timema_ stick insects, _Formica_ ants and barn owls. I plan to use these distinct systems to shed light on the effect of hybridization in the evolution of species and their adaption at different levels of species divergence.
