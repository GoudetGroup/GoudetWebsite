  description: Parasites that rely on their host for feeding and reproduction should be influenced by the historical and ecological processes shaping their host populations. Investigating the population genetic structure of such parasites provides valuable insights into parasite transmission and host behaviour. Seasonal aggregation and sex-specific segregation of bats make them interesting models for studying parasite population genetics. The dynamic life cycle of bats influences their susceptibility to parasitism thereby affecting parasite transmission. In this project, we are using double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) to investigate the population genetic structure of two metapopulations of bat ectoparasites. The bat fly Nycteribia kolenatii and the bat mite Spinturnix andegavinus, two obligate parasites of the Daubenton’s bat but with different biology. We also characterize the population genetic structure of the Daubenton’s bat to understand if the dispersal of the parasites is driven by the high mobility of the bat. To do so, we capture bat and their ectoparasites across maternity colonies and foraging sites in Vaud canton, Switzerland.
